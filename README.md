# 1stwebsiteProject
This is a navbar I created, with a layout for the main content having 3 sections, divided in a specific way, with a footer below.


Hey, so this project is ongoing, I'm basically learning css, and this is my first time implementing what I learnt. I didn't use any tutorials, I did google stuff like
"how to do this" or how to do "x", and so on. I started with a navbar, then went on to make a footer, Thats where it stands on 12/10/20. I might do the content of the page, might
start a different project, who knows. Thank you for reading, have a nice day.
